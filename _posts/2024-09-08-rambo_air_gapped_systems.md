# RAMBO: Exploiting Air-Gapped Systems via Radio Signals

Air-gapped systems are often considered one of the most secure setups, designed to isolate critical systems from external networks and the internet. However, a recently discovered attack vector known as **RAMBO** (Radio Memory Buses Operation) challenges this assumption.

## What is RAMBO?

RAMBO is an advanced side-channel attack that exploits electromagnetic emissions generated by a computer's RAM. In a compromised system, malware can manipulate these emissions to encode sensitive information such as files, keylog data, and encryption keys into radio signals. These signals can be intercepted and decoded by attackers using software-defined radio (SDR) hardware and a basic antenna from a nearby location.

## Key Highlights

- **Air-Gapped System Vulnerability**: Even without network access, malware can leak data from air-gapped systems by leveraging electromagnetic emissions from RAM.
- **Data Extraction**: Information can be exfiltrated at speeds up to 1000 bits per second, making it feasible to leak files, encryption keys, and biometric data.
- **Hardware Requirements**: The attacker only needs SDR hardware and an off-the-shelf antenna to receive and decode the transmitted radio signals from nearby.

## How RAMBO Works

The attack works by causing the RAM to emit specific electromagnetic frequencies during its normal operation. Malware on the compromised machine manipulates this emission, encoding the data into a format that can be intercepted. Once the signals are captured, they can be decoded back into binary information, revealing the sensitive content.

## Implications

This discovery presents a significant threat to sectors relying on air-gapped systems for security, such as military installations, government facilities, and critical infrastructure operations. Traditional air-gapping may no longer be enough to protect sensitive data from sophisticated cyber threats.

## Countermeasures

While mitigation strategies like shielding memory modules and using signal jammers have been proposed, the evolving nature of side-channel attacks requires ongoing attention. Organizations must rethink their security posture for air-gapped environments to counter such sophisticated attack vectors.
