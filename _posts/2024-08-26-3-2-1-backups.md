The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a widely recommended approach to ensure data redundancy and recovery in the event of data loss, corruption, or disaster. The principle behind the 3-2-1 strategy is simple yet effective:

### 1. **Three Copies of Your Data:**
   - **Why?** Having three copies ensures that even if one or two copies are lost or corrupted, there is still at least one remaining copy that can be used to recover the data.
   - **What?** This includes the original data (e.g., the data on your computer) plus two additional backups.

### 2. **Two Different Media Types:**
   - **Why?** Storing backups on two different types of media reduces the risk of data loss due to hardware failure, software bugs, or other issues that might affect a single type of storage medium.
   - **What?** For example, one copy of your data could be stored on an external hard drive, while another could be stored on a USB flash drive, optical discs (like DVDs or Blu-rays), or a NAS (Network-Attached Storage).

### 3. **One Copy Offsite:**
   - **Why?** An offsite backup protects against disasters that could affect your local environment, such as fire, flood, or theft. If all your backups are in the same location and that location is compromised, you risk losing everything.
   - **What?** The offsite backup can be stored in the cloud, at a remote location (e.g., a family member’s house), or in a secure data center.

### Example Implementation of 3-2-1 Backup:
1. **Primary Copy:** Data stored on your computer or main server.
2. **Local Backup (Different Media):** Data backed up on an external hard drive or a NAS device.
3. **Offsite Backup:** Data backed up to a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Amazon S3, or on an external hard drive stored in a different physical location.

### Benefits of 3-2-1 Backup:
- **Redundancy:** Even if one backup fails, you still have multiple others to fall back on.
- **Versatility:** Different media types and offsite storage protect against a wide range of potential data loss scenarios.
- **Reliability:** By following the 3-2-1 rule, you ensure that your data is safe from various risks including hardware failures, natural disasters, and human errors.

### Considerations:
- **Automation:** Automating the backup process can help ensure that backups are consistently updated without requiring manual intervention.
- **Encryption:** For offsite backups, particularly those stored in the cloud, encrypting the data is crucial to protect it from unauthorized access.
- **Testing:** Regularly test your backups to ensure they can be successfully restored when needed.
The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a robust and reliable method for protecting your data by ensuring that you always have multiple copies available in different locations and on different media. Let Subvertec help you with backup planning or implementation so you can focus on your clients.
