*If you’ve followed our [basic Pi-hole setup guide](/how-to-setup-pi-hole-with-docker-compose), you already have an ad-free, secure network. But there’s much more that Pi-hole can do! In this advanced guide, we’ll show you how to unlock its full potential with custom block lists, DNS filtering, performance tweaks, and integration with other security tools.*

##  Custom Block Lists

Pi-hole comes preloaded with a basic ad-blocking list, but you can significantly enhance its capabilities by adding **custom block lists** to filter specific content like malware, adult sites, or tracking domains.

### How to Add Custom Block Lists:
  - Access the Pi-hole admin interface: ```http://<pi-hole-ip>/admin```
  - Navigate to *Adlists*
  - Add the URLs of your desired block lists. Here are some popular block lists:
    [The adlist that I use by hagezi on github](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists) (you will have to browse to find the adlist that fits your situation best, below is the 'general use' list)
    ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/multi.txt```
    ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts```
  - Click *Save* and then update Pi-hole by running: 
    ```pihole -g```

### Where to Find Block Lists:
  - Popular sources for block lists include:
    - [firebog.net](https://firebog.net/)
    - [OISD](https://oisd.nl/)
    - reddit can yield some good results as well

##  Network-Wide DNS Filtering

Pi-hole can be expanded into a **network-wide DNS filtering solution**, helping to block access to known malicious websites, phishing domains, and unwanted content across all devices on your network.

### Set Up DNS Filtering:
  - Edit the DHCP configuration for your network (usually it's your 'wireless router' that functions as a DHCP server) You will simply add the IP of your pi-hole installation to the first DNS entry. You'll have to wait for the lease time to expire, this can vary between networks.

##  Optimizing Pi-hole Performance

To ensure Pi-hole runs efficiently, especially on larger networks or Raspberry Pi setups, consider the following optimizations:

### Hardware Optimization:
  - For high-traffic networks, consider upgrading to a more powerful device, such as a Raspberry Pi 4 or a dedicated mini-server.
  - Reduce logging frequency for a smoother experience on lower-power devices:
    ```pihole -l 24h``` (reduces DNS log storage to 24 hours)

### Caching DNS Queries:
  - Enable DNS caching to reduce latency on frequently visited websites. This can be done by adjusting the **cache-size** in the Pi-hole settings.

### Whitelisting Critical Domains:
  - Some services (e.g., banking, streaming) may experience issues with aggressive blocking. You can whitelist critical domains through the admin interface:
    Go to *Domains*
    Add any domains that should bypass blocking and click 'Add to Whitelist'.

##  Conclusion

With these advanced configurations, your Pi-hole setup can evolve from a simple ad blocker to a comprehensive network security tool. Whether you’re optimizing for performance, expanding your filtering capabilities, or integrating with other security tools, Pi-hole offers immense flexibility.
