## Non Traditional 'Backups'
A backup doesn't require an expensive and complex system. A backup is nothing more than a copy. There are different types of backups which we won't really go into here, since we're going over free methods to backup your files. This is also for Windows systems, since that's what most people use. The three that we'll go into here will be:
- **Drag and Drop Method**
- **Windows Backup**
- **Robocopy**

## Drag and Drop Backup
This backup is the easiest to perform. It involves placing some kind of writable media (usually a flash drive or external hdd) into the host computer and selecting the files you want to copy and dragging them to the media. Holding 'ctrl' will ensure the data is only COPIED and not MOVED. IF you want to move the data, you can hold the shift button. 

## Windows Backup

Windows Backup is another option you can use to ensure your data is safe. You can access it by opening your start menu and typing 'backup' and clicking the 'Windows Backup' icon. This option backs up your data to the cloud. This covers your basic data areas that are associated with your user. This option may not fit some users that may have important data located elsewhere on the machine, but for most people/organizations, this is where the meat and potatoes of your data reside. 

## Robocopy

Robocopy is a great way to backup, I've used it for years professionally for smaller organizations that really can't afford a full backup solution. Robocopy is very powerful and has some very useful flags for backups. This includes copying permissions from the source files. You'll need to be an administrator to run this application on some folders due to security permissions. The great thing about robocopy is you can easily schedule a task to run as often as you you like (assuming you have the space of course)

## Conclusion

Backing up your data is essential for ensuring the safety and integrity of your information, especially in the face of unforeseen circumstances like hardware failure or cyber threats. By utilizing the free and built-in tools available on Windows, you can implement effective backup strategies without incurring extra costs.
